Title: Logos
----
Text: The SK&A and ETI logos function in a system: a few basic conventions apply to dozens of available variations. Prebuilt lockups and logo variations for almost every use case can be downloaded from this site; if you need a particular logo, always check for it in this styleguide before you attempt to build your own lockup. The lockups on this website have been carefully constructed to account for spacing, proportions, weight, color, leading and kerning, and have been adjusted for consistent appearance in a variety of contexts. In general, it's not recommended that you attempt to make your own logo variation except in very special cases, because the company's mark and indentity should always be presented in a consistent way.

The SK&A logo is set in the classic Optima typeface but uses a customized ampersand (&) character. The ETI logo is set in Rockwell. "Complementary" text (such as "DC" in the "SK&A DC" version, or "Design" in "SK&A Design") is set in Gibson using varying weights and sizes. The typeface choices made in the logos are reflected in the overall font and type treatment guidelines for the brand; you can find more information about this in the "Type Treatments" section of this guide.

### Usage

When placing a logo in a document or interface, please observe a few simple guidelines.

#### Spacing

The logo needs a little breathing room. Please leave a margin on all sides approximately equivalent to the size of the "K" in SK&A and the "T" in ETI. Use this margin not only with the basic logo (illustrated below) but also with the various lockups.

#### Best Practices

 As mentioned above, the logo files in this styleguide are meant to be used as-is. The cases where you might need to modify a logo file are likely to be extremely rare (and it is recommended you consult a designer if you need to do so).

 **Please do not...**

 (image: no-color.png alt: Do not modify the color)
